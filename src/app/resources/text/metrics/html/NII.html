Number of interfaces that current class implements.<br>
This is an adaptation of "Number of superclasses" metric, but  since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance,<br>
here only implementation is observed. 
Calculated by counting the implementation dependencies of the class node in the type dependency graph.
